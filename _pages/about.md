I am a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University in the Department of Chemical Engineering, advised by [Prof. Scott Banta](https://bantalab.cheme.columbia.edu/). My research focuses on engineering and evolving proteins to achieve non-natural biological functions, with applications in clean energy and the recovery of critical minerals. 

I am particularly interested in designing protein-based systems to enhance catalysis and developing biophysical platforms to study bacterial transition metal transporters. My work spans membrane protein biochemistry, bioinorganic chemistry, and synthetic biology.

Before joining Columbia, I earned my Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Texas at Dallas under the supervision of [Prof. Gabriele Meloni](http://www.melonilab.org/). My doctoral research focused on the structural and functional characterization of metal-binding membrane proteins, using proteoliposome-based biophysical tools and fluorescence spectroscopy. Following my Ph.D., I conducted postdoctoral research at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) at UT Southwestern Medical Center, where I developed proteoliposome-based platforms for the structural investigation of human ion channels under the mentorship of Prof. Youxing Jiang. I received my M.S. in Chemical Engineering with a focus on solar photocatalytic water splitting and my B.S. in Chemistry from the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka.
My broader research interests include membrane transport proteins, metal-protein interactions, biosensor development, and bioengineering for sustainable technologies.
