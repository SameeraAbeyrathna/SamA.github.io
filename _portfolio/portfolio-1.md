Nature has always been the greatest engineer. Over billions of years, life has evolved through natural selection—shaping organisms with remarkable resilience and complexity. From the elegance of photosynthesis to the survival of extremophiles thriving in boiling hot springs or freezing salt lakes, evolution has fine-tuned biological systems to perform awe-inspiring functions under unimaginable conditions.

At its core, evolution works at the molecular level, sculpting biomolecules like enzymes and proteins to adapt and survive. This powerful concept of molecular evolution is the foundation of my scientific curiosity. My research is inspired by nature’s ingenuity, and in my future lab, inspired by natural evolution I aim to evolve proteins and enzymes by directed evelotion workflos to perform novel and industrially relevant functions.

I am also fascinated by how organisms sense and respond to their environment. By engineering these natural sensory mechanisms, I plan to develop next-generation biosensors that can detect everything from environmental toxins to disease markers with precision and speed.

But evolution also has its dark side. The rise of antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest threats to modern medicine—a direct consequence of evolutionary pressure. My lab will develop biotechnological tools to study and counteract these threats, identifying new therapeutic targets and designing strategies to understand their molecualr mechanism to devlop noval next generation medicinces.

Through this work, I hope to contribute not just to our understanding of life, but to building a healthier, more sustainable world.
